   # Email Configuration
   EMAIL_TESTING_MODE=false  # Set to false to send real emails
   USE_SUPABASE_EMAIL=false  # Use Gmail instead of Supabase

   # Gmail SMTP Configuration
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_EMAIL=your-gmail@gmail.com  # Replace with your Gmail address

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: "SMTP Authentication failed"

**Causes:**
- Wrong Gmail address
- Wrong App Password
- 2-Step Verification not enabled
- App Password revoked

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check Gmail address in `.env`
2. Verify App Password (no typos, include/exclude spaces consistently)
3. Ensure 2-Step Verification is ON
4. Generate a new App Password if needed

---

### Problem: "Connection timeout"

**Causes:**
- Firewall blocking port 587
- Network issues
- Gmail SMTP temporarily unavailable

**Solutions:**
1. Check firewall settings (allow port 587)
2. Try a different network
3. Wait a few minutes and try again

---

### Problem: Emails going to spam

**Causes:**
- New Gmail account
- High sending volume
- Spam filters

**Solutions:**
1. **Warm up** your Gmail account:
   - Send emails slowly at first
   - Wait 24-48 hours between sending batches
   - Gradually increase volume

2. **Ask recipients to**:
   - Mark email as "Not Spam"
   - Add your Gmail to contacts
   - Create filter to inbox

3. **Use a reputable Gmail account**:
   - Older accounts have better reputation
   - Accounts with normal usage history

4. **Consider paid email service** for production:
   - SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES
   - Better deliverability
   - Higher sending limits

---

### Problem: "Too many requests" error

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded (3 emails per 5 minutes)

**Solution:**
- Wait 5 minutes before trying again
- This is intentional to prevent spam
- Rate limits reset automatically

---

### Problem: Backend shows testing mode despite EMAIL_TESTING_MODE=false

**Cause:** `.env` file not loaded properly

**Solutions:**
1. Restart backend server completely
2. Check `.env` file has no typos
3. Verify `.env` is in backend directory
4. Check terminal logs for "Email Service initialized - Testing Mode: False"

- **Free Gmail:** 500 emails/day
- **Google Workspace:** 2,000 emails/day

**Rate Limits:**

## üöÄ Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

SMTP_EMAIL=your-production-gmail@gmail.com

```

### 2. Email Service Recommendations

- $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- Very cheap for high volume
- Requires AWS setup
- Best for scale

**Mailgun**
- 5,000 emails/month free
- Good documentation
- Reliable service

### 3. Domain Email

For professional appearance:
1. Get custom domain (e.g., `ntufood.com`)

3. Configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
4. Use with SendGrid/AWS SES
